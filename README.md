Chromatic
=========

The goal of the Chromatic project is to re-enable MathML in Chromium and more
generally to add MathML support to all Blink-based browsers.

* Upstream bug entry: [Enabling support for MathML](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=152430).
* chromatic.svg: a [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle)-shaped version of the Chromium logo.
* blink-enable-mathml-2013-08-24.diff: experimental patch importing the
WebKit MathML code. It has been generated with the help of a script. This is
only an attempt I made during one day of Summer 2013 and it is not usable!
